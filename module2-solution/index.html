            <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, 
              as opposed to natural intelligence displayed by animals including humans.
              AI applications include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google), 
              recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon and Netflix), 
              understanding human speech (such as Siri and Alexa), self-driving cars 
              (e.g., Tesla), automated decision-making and competing at the highest 
              level in strategic game systems (such as chess and Go).</p>

            <p>Machine learning (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that can 
              improve automatically through experience and by the use of data. It is 
              seen as a part of artificial intelligence. Machine learning algorithms 
              build a model based on sample data, known as training data, in order to 
              make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to 
              do so. Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of 
              applications, such as in medicine, email filtering, speech recognition, 
              and computer vision, where it is difficult or unfeasible to develop 
              conventional algorithms to perform the needed tasks.</p>

            <p>Data science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific 
              methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and 
              insights from noisy, structured and unstructured data, and apply 
              knowledge and actionable insights from data across a broad range of 
              application domains. Data science is related to data mining, machine 
              learning and big data. Another definition establishes it is a "concept 
              to unify statistics, data analysis, informatics, and their related 
              methods" in order to "understand and analyze actual phenomena" with 
              data.</p>
